I am Ariana Yekrangi, an independent journalist and editor, based in Helsinki. From 2016 to 2025, I was the Chair of UN-aligned, a Finland-based NGO working to reform the United Nations, and also served as the Editor of The Gordian, the organisationâ€™s monthly publication. In this role, I led the publication of insightful pieces on world peace, human rights, animal welfare and environmental issues.

I specialise in research, fact-checking and shaping stories that are both meaningful and impactful. Over the years, I have worked across various media platforms, refining messages and overseeing editorial processes. I take pride in managing teams, and I have received awards for mentoring interns and helping them develop their skills and confidence.

In addition to my work in journalism, I have an interest in digital media and design, always looking for new ways to tell stories and engage audiences. Outside of work, I compose contemporary classical music, offering me a different way to express and shape ideas.
