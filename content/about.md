Hey, I’m Ariana Yekrangi, a journalist, editor and communications specialist based in Helsinki. I spend my days researching, fact-checking, and shaping words into something meaningful—whether that’s through journalism, editorial work, or content strategy.

I’m also the Co-founder and Chair of UN-aligned, a Finland-based NGO working towards a better United Nations. Since 2020, I’ve been the Editor of The Gordian, the organisation’s monthly publication, where I help put together bold and thought-provoking pieces on world peace, human rights, animal welfare and environmental issues. It is a bit of a labour of love, but it is worth it when people tell me our work made them see things in a new way.

Over the years, I have worked across different media platforms, refining messages, managing editorial processes and making sure ideas are delivered with clarity and impact. I have also won awards for managing small teams and training like-minded interns, something I take particular pride in. Helping others develop their skills and confidence is one of the more rewarding aspects of my work.

I have a soft spot for good design and engaging storytelling, so I also dabble in digital media and the occasional bit of graphic design.

Outside of work, I compose contemporary classical music. It is a different way of shaping ideas, but it keeps things interesting.
